## Description

This project simulates an art gallery in your browser using [REGL](https://github.com/regl-project/regl).
It aims at reproducing the experience of a real art gallery.
The architecture is generated using a 10km long 6th order [Hilbert Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve).
The paintings are asynchronously loaded from the [ARTIC](https://api.artic.edu) and placed on the walls.
You can use this project to display your own artworks.
